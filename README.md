This is a school project for my Master's in Computer Science at Universidade Federal do Paran√°
April, 2018

Created by Eric Eduardo Bunese

The goal of this project is to create a new encryption algorithm based upon "classic" encryption algorithms, such as Caesar's Cypher, Playfair Cypher, Rail Fence and Vingenere.
In this project, I have modified the regular Vingenere Cypher to include a constant-based offset, in order to hide the key used in the cypher.

The constant based was an array created using the first digits of PI, and can be easily expanded by adding further digits to it. The more, the merrier.

Further documentation can be found in the file "vingeneric.pages", currently available in Brazilian Portuguese.
